### CONTRACTS

(A reflection on contracts).

Last week I watched another round of European hysteria over American actions.

This time it was because the Americans had the nerve to admit that NATO isn’t their number one priority. That defending Ukraine is even further down the line. And they also said that the key party in Europe’s defense should be, well… Europe itself.

**THEY’RE GOING TO DROP THE MOST IMPORTANT AGREEMENT OF THE 20TH CENTURY.**

Only in Europe people treat agreements like sacred notary acts. Let’s not forget we once said the same about the European Union, that it was “the greatest invention of the 20th century.”

A contract is great, sure, but practice always matters more. Relying on a piece of paper is risky business, especially when that piece of paper turned 75 last year.

**AIRPLANES. TV'S. PENICILIN. NUCLEAR ENERGY. COMPUTERS & SEMICONDUCTORS. ROCKETSHIPS & MOON LANDERS. THE INTERNET.**

Europe is wrong.

In life and in business, my experience is that contracts are the least important part of any long relationship. For example, it’s ridiculous to expect a marriage to survive just because you signed a piece of paper and said some nice words a decade ago. Anyone who’s ever worn a wedding band knows that marriage has to be worked on every single day. With attention, mutual investment, and above all a healthy dose of humor.

The same goes for startups. Sure, there’s an agreement between founders and investors filed stored somewhere. But it’s the daily grind, the commitment, the wins, and the trust that actually makes things move forward. Cracking a good joke helps too. 

**FOR BETTER FOR WORSE, FOR RICHER FOR POORER, IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH, TILL DEATH DO US PART.**

I've seen shareholders agreements be changed, ignored, scrapped, depending on the relative strengths of the parties. Contracts exist to sort out legal details, but that's not reality, no one lives permanently surrounded by judges and regulations. Any action I take that feeds my love and my business is infinitely more important than the piece of paper that exists between us. And if things go south, contracts only help contain the damage.

**WE’RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT.**

If my theory is right, the U.S. will start paying a lot more attention to NATO when Europe actually steps up. When the Russian Navy stops playing submarine hide-and-seek in our waters, be they the Portuguese, Spanish, French, or British.

America will treat us as equals when Russia respects our borders.

**WHEN WE RESPECT OUR OWN BORDERS.**

I think the time is coming for Europe to reform. We’re a big continent, rich and populous. We have historic cities and stunning nature like my Portugal’s coastline. We have millions of creative people, inventors, and we actually get along pretty well among ourselves. (Even the rowdy Spanish and French, who love to fight, prefer the brotherly infighting within Borders).

We have to turn Europe into what it could be and drop the act. We can't play the surprised, hurt victim.

Especially given the new crop of folk trying to chime in. What we really need is more contracts, they say. A new way to register businesses (EU Inc.). A federalized Europe. A European Constitution. More presidents, more commissions, more projects, compasses, programs, and directives. A joint Military. All that, plus a shiny new agreement to distribute hundreds of billions in AI funding.

**AND THAT’S FINE.**

But it won’t help much.

All these ideas assume that signing an agreement will solve things. But contracts are usually the wrong first step. If there’s a problem, we should fix it now, not wait for an agreement.

If Germany wants simpler business rules, they can start by scrapping their ridiculous notary requirements. If France wants to help Ukraine, it can send more money and troops. Walk the talk, alone if needed. Be frontal and bold about what you believe in, and do it. 

If Portugal wants to be more competitive, fix our insane maze of bureaucracy that kills small businesses. No need to even touch taxes (which, yes, are high and not competitive in a global talent-driven economy). Just cutting through the red tape would do wonders.

In short: fix problems first, iterate, and only later scale those solutions across Europe. The culture of results always beats trying to come up with the “best idea” at the top and forcing it down people’s throats.

It's actually a bit worse than that. There isn’t even a democratic mandate for Europe to keep signing away national responsibilities. The quiet federalization we’re seeing is, frankly, embarrassing. Especially for those of us who actually believe in a more united Europe. Do they think we're dumb? 

No one voted for a European Army. No one voted for a new way to register businesses, no matter how good it is. These things weren’t election issues in any country. No one is stepping up and taking responsibility. Everything is outsourced. Blame and Solutions.

It’s the Russians’ fault. The Americans’ fault. COVID’s fault. So Europe did what we did best. We called in the former European Central Bank (ECB) governor Mario Draghi and tasked him to write a report. He concluded we need more competitiveness and and boom, now we will have a new way to register companies (EU Inc regime), plus a whole bunch of new things.

The Americans are telling us to increase military spending or they’ll pull support? Guess we’d better start thinking about an Army.

**IT’S JUST ANOTHER PIECE OF PAPER.**

Time to recap. There is a bit of histerya and concern at the moment because of external events around us. 

But what goes on inside is more important. I suspect that a lot of Europeans don’t feel respected in Europe. We live comfortable lives, but we have little agency. Ordinary people and businesses don’t matter much to those in power. This feels like so many people in their failed marriages and companies. What about the contract? The original contract of liberal democracy is breaking down. 

It's no use whining about the Americans, who are fighting their own internal battle over values, led by an egomaniac. And contracts are part of life, but they don’t make things happen. So f*** contracts. We will believe in ourselves and make things happen, and will join our partners in strength.
