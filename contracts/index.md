### CONTRACTS

(A reflection on contracts).

Last week I watched another round of European hysteria over American rethoric and actions.

This time it was because the Americans had the nerve to admit that NATO isn’t their number one priority. That defending Ukraine is even further down the line, unless they get a direct benefit. And they also said that the key party in Europe’s defense should be, well… Europe itself.

**THEY’RE GOING TO DROP THE MOST IMPORTANT AGREEMENT OF THE 20TH CENTURY.**

Only in Europe people treat agreements like sacred notary acts. Let’s not forget we once said the same about the European Union, that it was “the greatest invention of the 20th century.”

A contract is great, sure. The EU and NATO are among the best agreements ever made. Words matter. But practice always matters more. Relying on a piece of paper is risky business, especially when that piece of paper turned 75 last year. 

**AIRPLANES. TV'S. PENICILIN. NUCLEAR ENERGY. COMPUTERS & SEMICONDUCTORS. ROCKETSHIPS & MOON LANDERS. THE INTERNET.**

Europe is wrong.

In life and in business, my experience is that contracts are the least important part of any long relationship. For example, it’s ridiculous to expect a marriage to survive just because you signed a piece of paper and said some nice words a decade ago. Anyone who’s ever worn a wedding band knows that marriage has to be worked on every single day. With attention, mutual investment, and above all a big side of humor.

The same goes for startups. Sure, there’s an agreement between founders and investors that gets filed and stored somewhere. But it’s the daily grind, the commitment, the wins, and the trust that actually makes things move forward. Cracking a good joke helps too. 

The same happens here. NATO and Europe are good things, but they must be lived and defended by those who profess such paper love for them.

**FOR BETTER FOR WORSE, FOR RICHER FOR POORER, IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH, TILL DEATH DO US PART.**

Let us abstain from commenting on the varied treacheries, back stabbings and general egotistic actions people do on their personal lives.

On the professional front, I have seen shareholders agreements be nullified or written over. A few times it was because people just ignored the contracts altogether. Most of the times it was because of changes in the powerbalance when a party asserted themselves. Someone wanted more, and the existing contract is just a blocker to be overcome.

Contracts establish legal details, but that's not reality, no one lives permanently surrounded by judges and regulations only and isolated from everything else. No CEO that I know asks themselves "what is in my contract"? We're social beings, trying to make daily improvements. With a few exceptions, contracts govern just extreme things, like the dissolution of a company, what happens when a CEO leaves, etc.  At the event horizon, laws of physics breakdown and everything becomes spaghetti.

I conclude that any action I take that posivitely feeds my business or my family is infinitely more important than the piece of paper that exists between us. And if things go south, contracts only help contain the damage at best.

**WE’RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT.**

If my theory is right, the U.S. will start paying a lot more attention to NATO when Europe actually steps up. When the Russian Army doesn't dare cross boundaries. When Russian spies stop killing people in Europe soil. When Russia's Navy stops playing submarine hide-and-seek in our waters, be they the Portuguese, Spanish, French, or British.

America will treat us as equals when Russia respects our borders.

**WHEN WE RESPECT OUR OWN BORDERS.**

The U.S. is also a flashpoint of rethoric and bulshit. The entire woke culture and the MAGA act were built on 100 character memes. Words are essy.

But when the time comes, the U.S. has real tools, like the most advanced economy in the world, which is a magnet for talent and more innovation, and the mightiest military.

I think the time is coming for Europe to reform. It's a bit late, but we cam do it. We’re a big continent, rich and populous. We have beautiful historic cities and stunning nature like my Portugal’s coastline. We have millions of creative people, and many brilliant inventors, and we actually get along pretty well among ourselves. (Even the rowdy Spanish and French, who love to fight, prefer brotherly infighting to picking fights with other EU countries).

We have to turn Europe into what it could be and drop the act. We can't play the surprised, hurt spouse. This has been a long time coming.

It is especially important to do it fix Europe the right way. There's a new crop of folk trying to chime in, and they say what we really need is more contracts. Ah! What we're missing is a new way to register businesses (EU Inc.). A federalized Europe. A European Constitution. More presidents, more commissions, more projects, compasses, programs, and directives. A joint Military. All that, plus a shiny new agreement to distribute hundreds of billions in AI funding.

**AND THAT’S FINE.**

That's all good. But it won’t help much.

All these ideas assume that signing an agreement will solve things. But contracts are usually the wrong first step. If there’s a problem, we should fix it now, not wait for an agreement.

If Germany wants simpler business rules, they can start by scrapping their ridiculous notary requirements. If France wants to help Ukraine, it can send more money and troops directly. Walk the talk, alone if needed. Be frontal and bold about what you believe in, and do it. 

If Portugal wants to be more competitive, fix our insane maze of bureaucracy that kills small businesses. No need to even touch taxes (which, yes, are high and not competitive in a global talent-driven economy). Just cutting through the red tape would do wonders.

In short: fix problems first, iterate, and only later scale those solutions across Europe. The culture of results always beats trying to come up with the “best idea” at the top and forcing it down people’s throats.

The solutions being thrown around around just wrong in my view, it's actually a bit worse than that. There isn’t even a democratic mandate for Europe to keep signing away national responsibilities. The quiet federalization we’re seeing is, frankly, embarrassing. Especially for those of us who actually believe in a more united Europe. 

Our first reaction to our current situation was to do what Europe does best. We called in the former European Central Bank (ECB) governor Mario Draghi and tasked him to write a report. He concluded we need more competitiveness and and boom, now we will have a new way to register companies (EU Inc regime), plus a whole bunch of new things. The Americans are telling us to increase military spending or they’ll pull support? Guess we’d better start thinking about an Army.

But no one voted for a European Army. No one voted for a new way to register businesses, no matter how good it is. These things weren’t election issues in any country. No one is stepping up and taking responsibility. Everything is outsourced. Blame and Solutions. 

"It’s Putin's fault". "Trump's fault". "COVID’s fault". 

**ANOTHER PIECE OF PAPER.**

Time to recap. There is a bit of concern at the moment because of external events around us. 

But what goes on inside Europe is more important. I suspect that a lot of Europeans don’t feel respected in Europe. We live comfortable lives, but we have little agency. Ordinary people and businesses don’t matter much to those in power. This feels like so many people in their failed marriages and companies. What about the contract? The original contract of a liberal democracy is breaking down. 

It's no use whining about the Americans, who are fighting their own internal battle over values, led by an egomaniac. 

Contracts and agreements are part of life, but they don’t make things happen. So f*** contracts. 

We must believe in ourselves and make things happen, and then we can join our partners in strength.
