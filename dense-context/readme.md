So.

The last three days [this post](https://x.com/patife/status/1906442934343634951) went viral, with multiple reposts on Instagram and Facebook, Linkedin, and endless forwarding on Whatsapp. A friend sent me a video of two old people laughing over the images on a shopping mall.

I’ve been asked a couple hundred times on Twitter and elsewhere, so I’m attaching the prompt and an example image below. 

Before we get to the How, a word if I may.

The point of my post was to make people laugh, and because why not. We all laughed a bunch.. Remember that we’re living in an over abundance of information. Most of it is bullshit. Even most of the stuff serious people put on serious books is crap. A way to cut through it is to condense information. GIFs, Emojis, Memes, are a way of sharing a thought fast.  



Instructions

<details><summary>Example prompt</summary>

> Create image. Create a toy of the person in the photo. Let it be an action figure. Next to the figure, there should be the toy's equipment, each in its individual blisters. 1) a book called "Tecnoforma". 2) A 3-headed dog with a tag that says "Troika" and a bone at its feet with word "austerity" written on it. 3) a three-headed Hydra with with a tag called "Geringonça". 4) a book titled "D. Sebastião". Don't repeat the equipment under any circumstance. The card holding the blister should be strong orange. Also, on top of the box, write 'Pedro Passos Coelho' and underneath it, ‘PSD action figure'. The figure and equipment must all be inside blisters. Visualize this in a realistic way.
