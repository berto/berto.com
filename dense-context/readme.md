So.

On Sunday night I did [a post](https://x.com/patife/status/1906442934343634951) on X that went viral. The post shows a bunch of politicians running for government in Portugal and the controversies they're known for. It had multiple reposts on Instagram and Facebook, Linkedin, and endless forwarding on Whatsapp. A friend even sent me a video of two old people laughing over the images on a shopping mall.

I’ve been asked a couple hundred times on Twitter and elsewhere, so I’m attaching the prompt and an example image at the end. 

Before we get to the How, a word if I may.

The point of my post was to make people laugh, and because why not. We all laughed a bunch.. Remember that we’re living in an over abundance of information. Most of it is bullshit. Even most of the stuff serious people put on serious books is crap. A way to cut through it is to condense information. GIFs, Emojis, Memes, are a way of sharing a thought fast.

This was done on March 31st 2025. Models will become more advanced. 

1) Go on ChatGPT and choose model 4o.
2) Upload an image of the person. Make it a clear, well lit image that shows the face.
3) Copy this prompt, and adapt it to the person and what you want there.

> Create image. Create a toy of the person in the photo. Let it be an action figure. Next to the figure, there should be the toy's equipment, each in its individual blisters. 1) a book called "Tecnoforma". 2) A 3-headed dog with a tag that says "Troika" and a bone at its feet with word "austerity" written on it. 3) a three-headed Hydra with with a tag called "Geringonça". 4) a book titled "D. Sebastião". Don't repeat the equipment under any circumstance. The card holding the blister should be strong orange. Also, on top of the box, write 'Pedro Passos Coelho' and underneath it, ‘PSD action figure'. The figure and equipment must all be inside blisters. Visualize this in a realistic way.

4) Submit
5) Adjust. Sometimes the image will be cut. You have to ask ChatGPT to "draw the whole figure, including the full person". Other times the person will have legs cut, so just reply "you cut the legs, render the whole body". Another error is that the person isn't inside the plastic, so just reply "the person should be inside the blister". A few times the image just doesn't look good and I just replied "do it again, carefully." When I wasn't satisfied I started a new ChatGPT message and did it all over again. 

This is what it will look like in ChatGPT.

This is what a good result looks like.
