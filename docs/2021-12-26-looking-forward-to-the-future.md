# looking forward to the future

I compiled a list of products and services that I am very bullish on.

Spoiler: it's not VR or the metaverse and it's not Crypto and blockchains. I mean, I think those are exciting and I believe they will grow a lot. But there's already thousands of people with great visions working on those so i'm happy to tag along and just learn. The following are concepts which I think can still benefit from more passion.

Convenience
- On-demand Convenience stores. There's plenty of concepts poping up everywhere, with insane growth too. I am still bullish on yet new models though, as to this date existing player don't compare to the experience of buying in a Berlin spÃ¤ti.
- "Best-of" Food delivery. Uber Eats et al are expensive. Some player could commit to buying bulk quantities of the best dishes of a few very good restaurants, and trickle down that simplified cart and volume to a cheaper, less cluttered experience. Easier to discover, easier to order, cheaper to produce and buy.
- The next Pizza, delivered. Someone will put a lot of research into delivering the next mouth-watering foods that are deliverable to the home. Probably the next big thing is just another incarnation of the gang Pizza Pasta Burger Sushi Salad Bowl Burrito Ice-cream, or who knows maybe the next killer food is something else?

Robots
- Robots for delivery. Ok, this is a bit further down the line, but i'm hoping we start seeing happy little automated fuckers rolling down the streets to deliver packages, 24/7, instead of humans in large trucks. Just make them rubbery.
- Robots for cleaning. I love my 2 roombas (680, 980), but they're dumb as a hammer! I need my robots to clean better, faster, in more places (e.g. dust lamps).
- Robots for the industry. Duh. Anyting from warehouse surveillance to painting walls. I'd love to see them.

Vehicles
- Better bicycles. It has been suggested, and I'm all for it, that the next big thing is 3-motor ebikes with complete electronic transmission and shifting. I wonder who'll put out the first version. On traditional leg-powered bicycles, i'd love to see lighter options.

Hardware
- Satellite connections. I'd love to see sats providing the next generation of connectivity for phones, watches etc. Maybe Elon will answer our prayers and offer a "no-subscription" internet for all.

Software 
- Local first, cloud enabled software. Browsers are powerful, and they're plenty to manage a cloud saas where you go hit some buttons. But they're not providing the experience we deserve in everyday heavy productivity. I believe The next-generation of apps will do lot's of heavy lifting locally. I shouldn't have to suffer at the hands of half-second spinning wheels.
- Data. Without good questions, there's no smart decisions. Without data, you can't answer questions. We need better ways of exposing data to end-users. I see a couple of different products in this section: a) faucets to the world's public oceans of company/places/products data; b) tools to merge structured data from different private sources into a single normalized repository, say a CRM and an analytics tool; c) algorithms that extract data from unstructured sources, such as email and chat; and d) an editor where it's easy to answer questions through data (cof cof -> rows.com).
- Privacy and encryption. GDPR and Privacy Shield aren't going anywhere. The divide between the West and the new Giants will generate more needs and solutions for data access and consent.
- Software for remote Teams. We need a new kind of Facebook for teams. Something async enough to not be a distraction, and real enough to be fun and useful. 
- Hyperlink productivity. We shouldn't have to load links into a wiki or CRM database to use them. We need productivity that's as fast as browsing the web. Productivity for the link.
- Open "Low Code and No Code". The No-code philosophy of offering superpowers to end-users is just getting started. I hope we will see more tools here, especially those that are standards based (like rows.com; ok i'll stop with the shameless plug) and that can be ported, manipulated and used elsewhere. 
- Files. This touches Local-first software and No-code too. For end-users, *Files are simpler than APIs*: there's no pagination, no credentials, no rate-limiting or outages. APIs should work in the background, but it's images and videos and links people share. I wonder how all these concepts can be made to work together.
