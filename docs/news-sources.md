This is my current list of news sources:

World news

* [The Economist](https://www.economist.com) `Paid`. Global news that cover the economy, politics, sports and culture. I read perhaps 50% of the articles in full, the rest I just skim.
* [Espresso by The Economist](https://www.economist.com) `Free`. Short summary of daily news. I read it every day on my phone, in the morning. 
* [Washington Post](https://www.wapo.com) `Freemium`. I read most headlines, and usually deep dive on USA society topics. 
* Reuters for Apple TV `Free`. Up-to-date news in video format. The app auto-generates your choice of 10min, 15min or 30min of news. I love it, watch it about once per day when at home. 

Technology

* [Launch Ticker](https://www.launchticker.com) `Freemium`. Daily short news on what's going on in Tech. I read every single email carefully.
* [Stratechery](https://www.stratechery.com) `Paid`. Daily analysis of important Tech news with a strategy and business angle. Written by Ben Thompson. Articles are interesting, carefully written and feature non-trivial commentary on economic, legal and political issues. I read every single email in full. 
* [Dithering podcast](https://dithering.fm) `Paid`. Daily 15 min commentary on Tech, by Ben Thompson and John Gruber. I don't miss a show. 
* [Daring Fireball: The Talk Show podcast](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/) `Free`. Weekly podcast by John Gruber, the creator of Markdown and a long-time Apple commentator. I listen to about 50% of the episodes, mostly on long trips. 
* [ATP podcast](https://atp.fm) `Free`. Fun, weekly podcast that covers tech, Apple and programming. I listen to about 25% of the episodes, mostly on long trips. 

Life style

* The Atlantic `Paid`. Monthly lifestyle magazine. I have started to read it just 3 issues ago. 
 
Portugal

* [Governo Sombra](https://www.tsf.pt/programa/governo-sombra.html) `Free`. Commentary on Portuguese and World news. It's a great form of commentary. The 3 participants (+1 host) focus a lot on who said what and how; less than the actual content, like economic or social news; but in doing that, they expose very good points. I hear the podcast only, and never miss a single show.
