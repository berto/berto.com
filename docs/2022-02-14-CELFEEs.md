We have become too dependent on a centralized internet to power our online work and fun.

## A slow death.

Large outages of important business services are common enough to harm us. Google, Facebook, Notion, Slack have had severe outages about once a year, give or take. During those incidents we feel helpless and improductive, but secretely we welcome the strangeness of offlineness. We herd to non-affected apps to laugh at the memes and comment excitedly as the experts among us share news from formerly exotic news sites. Outages are exceptions in our monotonous software lives: countless accounts, frequent logins, browser tabs, social sharing, incremental releases, and subscriptions. 

More relevant than outages, though, is the sloweness of it all. The services we use nowadays are wholy dependent on internet connections, so the tasks we perform on our software are limited by the speed of the internet. Which is fast, but never fast enough. Browsing documents and reports is slow. Each search and filter forces our brain to wait another couple of hundred miliseconds. Our patience is slowly spent at the alter of convenience. Magic moments disappear. 

## Forever young.

Yet we also interface with all this cloud software via devices. Our brains are used to the speed of those devices, where at least some of the things we do are instantaneous. Some are even pretty complex things, like browsing our iPhone library with 50 thousands high-res photos; or playing a game. 

iPhones have come out every year for more than a decade, and each is quite better than the previous. Meanwhile, it feels like my Gmail and Google Calendar accounts haven't been updated in 10 years.. Even software that was shiny and new two years ago (as Notion), has become old and saggy.

## CELFEES

To combat the problems of outages and slowness, we could just use CELFEEs.

1. Cloud-Enabled: we want the cloud to collaborate with others and interact with machines (APIs), to store and retrieve our data. Cloud shouldn't mean slow or proprietary, rather invisible and distributed. Ideally, the cloud layer should be owned by the community, or at the very least a choice I can take.
2. Local-First: our data and files are to be stored locally for direct and fast manipulation. The commitment to keep data locally will force us to prioritize the user experience over a centralized, uniform database of sorts (if only). Our apps will render our data, not loading animations.
3. End2End encryped: we want everything encrypted. We will authorize some services to act on our behalf, sometimes automatically and for continued period of time. But files will be born locally, and carry the tribe ownership (your and me) over to the cloud.

I believe we will see more and more of these. At Rows.com we believe in this future, and we will try and make it true.
