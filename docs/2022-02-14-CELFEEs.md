We have become too dependent on a centralized internet to power our online work and fun.

## A slow death.

Large outages of important business services are common enough to harm us. Google, Facebook, Notion, Slack have had severe outages about once a year, give or take. During those incidents we feel helpless and improductive, but secretely we welcome the strangeness of offlineness. We herd to non-affected apps to laugh at the memes and comment excitedly as the experts among us share news from formerly exotic news sites. Outages are exceptions in our monotonous software lives: countless accounts, frequent logins, browser tabs, social over-sharing, incremental releases, and subscriptions. 

More relevant than outages, though, is the sloweness of it all. The services we use nowadays are wholy dependent on internet connections, so the tasks we perform on our software are limited by the speed of the internet. Which is fast, but never fast enough. This is especially prevalent in business tools, which have by-and-large transition to the browser, with few exceptions. Browsing documents and reports is slow. Each search and filter forces our brain to wait another couple of hundred miliseconds. Our patience is slowly spent at the alter of convenience. Magic moments disappear. 

## Forever young.

Yet we also interface with all this cloud software via fast devices. Our brains trust the speed of those devices, where at least some of the tasks we do are instantaneous. Some are even pretty complex, like browsing an iPhone library with 50 thousand high-resolution photos; or playing a 3D game. 

The truth is that smartphones have come out every year for more than a decade, and each is quite litteraly better than the previous. Meanwhile, it _feels_ like Gmail and Google Calendar haven't been updated in 10 years.. Even software that was shiny and new two years ago, has become old and saggy. (Yes, I'm thinking of Notion).

## CELFEES

To combat the problems of outages and slowness, we should transition to CELFEEs.

1. Cloud-Enabled: we want to collaborate with colleagues and clients and friends; we want to interface with machines (via APIs) to store and retrieve our data. We need the cloud for that. But "the cloud" we use shouldn't be slow or proprietary, rather invisible and distributed. Ideally, the cloud layer should be owned by the community or be an option where I get to pick the providers I want. This is already the case in Integrations, but not for other things: in Zapier as in Rows, you can pick from a list of CRMs and other competitor tools, but all your data is sync'ed to a single provider you can't opt-out of.
2. Local-First: our data and files should to be stored locally for direct and fast manipulation. The commitment to keep data locally will force us to prioritize the user experience over a centralized, uniform database (if only). Our apps will render our data, not loading animations.
3. End2End encryped: we want everything encrypted. We will authorize some services to act on our behalf, sometimes automatically and for continued period of time. But files will be born locally, and carry the rights that are born off locality (ownership, privacy) over to the cloud.

I believe we will see more and more of these. At Rows.com we believe in this future, and we will try and make it true.
