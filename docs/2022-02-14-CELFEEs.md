We have become too dependent on a centralized internet to power our online work and fun.

# A slow death.

Large outages of important business services are common enough to harm us. Google, Facebook, Notion, Slack have had severe outages about once a year, give or take. During those incidents we feel helpless and improductive, but secretely we welcome the strangeness of offlineness. We herd to non-affected apps to laugh at the memes and comment excitedly as the experts among us share news from formerly exotic news sites. Outages are exceptions in our monotonous software lives: countless accounts, frequent logins, browser tabs, social sharing, incremental releases, and subscriptions. 

More relevant than outages, though, is the sloweness of it all. The services we use nowadays are wholy dependent on internet connections, so the tasks we perform on our software are limited by the speed of the internet. Which is fast, but never fast enough. Browsing documents is slow, and each folder, search and filter takes another couple hundred-miliseconds. Our patience is slowly spent at the alter of convenience. Magic moments disappear. 

# Forever young.

Yet we also interface with all this cloud software via devices. Our brains know that on certain softwares and actions on those devices, things are instantaneous. Some are even pretty complex things, like browsing our iPhone library with 50 thousands high-res photos or playing a game. iPhones have come out every year for more than a decade, and they've managed to innovate every single time. Meanwhile, I think my Gmail account is still.

### CELFEES

To combat the problems of outages and slowness, we could just use CELFEEs.

1. Cloud-Enabled: we want the cloud to collaborate with others and interact with machines (APIs), to store and retrieve our data. Cloud shouldn't mean slow or proprietary, rather invisible and distributed. Ideally, the cloud layer should be owned by the community.
2. Local-First: your data and files should be stored locally for direct and fast manipulation. The commitment to keep data locally will force us to prioritize the user experience over a centralized, uniform data structure. So be it. Render data, not loading animations.
3. End2End encryped: we want everything encrypted. We will authorize some services to act on our behalf, sometimes automatically and for a while.
