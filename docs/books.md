*(WIP) (PT) Os dias loucos do PREC* | Adelino Gomes, José Pedro Castanheira | Recollection of the Hot Summer of 1975 in Portugal (11 March - 25 November) that followed the revolution of April 25th 1974 that replaced the dictatorial regime "Estado Novo". The account ends in the failed Communist coup and pro-democracy counter-coup of November 25th 1975. Mostly drawn from newspapers and publications, it has little narrative and even less commentary. | - | 4️⃣
The Spy and the Traitor | Ben Macintyre | The life of Oleg Gordievsky as a Russian spy who was a double agent working for the British SIS (MI6) and who had an impact on the Cold War and particularly on the UK PM Margaret Thatcher and USA president Ronald Reagan. Terrific account.  | 2020 | 5️⃣ |
Architecture Without Architects | Bernard Rudofsky | A short introduction to non-pedigreed architecture. This is a short book with black & white pictures of examples of early and non-modern architecture. It's curated but diverse, and beautiful.  | 2020 | 5️⃣ |
Prisoners of Geography | Tim Marshall | A view of the nations strengths and weaknesses - and fears - through the lenses of geopolitics. The author merges history and clever extrapolations to explain what we can expect of the peoples and nations in light of the rivers, mountains, plains, oceans and lakes that surround them. | 2020 | 5️⃣ |
Endurance | Alfred Lansing | The story of Ernest Schakleton. He and his crew of 27 got stranded when trying to reach and then cross Antarctica on foot, which was then uncharted. | 2019 | 5️⃣ |
Permanent Record | Edward Snowden | Autobiographic description of the upbringing of Ed Snowden who leaked the NSA mass surveillance programs. At times the book sounds too fatalistic, as if his path was written since a long time ago in his infant hacks, teenage school defiance, etc. Overall it gives a solid personal perspective of who he is and the steps before, during and after his he revelations. | 2019 | 4️⃣ |  
How it was/ (PT) Foi assim | Zita Seabra | The book tells the political life of the author. It includes her clandestine work for the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) during the Portuguese Dictatorship all the way through her expulsion from the Political Commission of the Central Committee of PCP. Very engaging story, with clear descriptions of the Communist Party, objectives and actions. | 2019 | 5️⃣
