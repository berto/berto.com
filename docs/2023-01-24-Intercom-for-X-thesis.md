# Thesis: Intercom for X

### The thesis

I believe that we will see the emergence of many Intercom-style applications. That is, Plug'n'play, Domain SaaS.

Competition within software categories is growing. On top of that, users increasingly demand top notch, custom experiences. As a result, companies must offer best-in-class solutions to their users AND at the same time they have to test varations and adaptations of those features to their specific needs.

Meanwhile, the ever growing demand for more software has also increased the cost of running engineering, product and design teams. The complexity of solutions creates many layers of frameworks, server and local code, data and UI, all of which are hard to build and harder to perfect. 

Intercom style businesses are well positioned to offer businesses a lot of value. With them, companies get the fastest time-to-market. Because the Intercom's are domain experts, they provide proven solutions. They give businesses a full-stack software from day 1: UX, software, metrics, backoffice, all is included. Lastly, they give teams the power to customize things to their needs, without consuming precious engineering time.

### Intro

I come at this thesis from 2 angles.
- The cost of developing a product is the largest or 2nd largest expense for many startups and online businesses.
- The speed at which companies ship product is a competitive factor, as it permits differentiation and more value add.

The faster you can build your product, the more you can iterate, fail, learn, and ultimately succceed in solving your users problems. The faster you build a product, the faster you can deliver quality too. 

A company that delivers fast is better for investors. They succeed on the upside of a few outcomes and accept a majority of duds. They are interested in fast outcomes.

### The observation

Intercom offers companies a simple trade-off:
- you add two lines of code to your software
- you pay them a (big) monthly fee
- they give you a plug-n-play solution for connecting to your customers at any time, in different ways:
    - they started out with a Chat (for support)
    - then they automated that support with quick answers (bots)
    - they now offer other solutions, like pro-active guides for onboarding, messages etc.

The beauty of their solution is that once you add the code snippet, almost everything is automatic and configurable in their platform. You can always add more or less bells and whistles later.

No more engineering time, launching experiments, etc. Once you install the product, it's also sticky. Your marketing team depends on it, and uses more and more of those features, making a migration or insourcing increasingly unlikely.

### Key ingredients

- Plug-n-play: you invest engineering effort once to integrate, and that's it. You're ready to go.
- Full-stack tech: they give you everything you need: back-end, front-end, UI customization, automations, data collection, etc. This is not an API, or a headless service (API + Back-office), or a developer tool (library, framework, or SDK).
- Low-code: everything else, you do visually. Customization colors, actions, flows, add new things.

### Key benefit

Speed. With Intercom, marketing operates at the speed of marketing, not at the speed of tech.

### Vs Other solutions

- APIs are great, but take a long time to understand and integrate.
- Headless systems require lots of frontend code and UX solutions.
- Full SaaS offerings aren't costumizable enough and you're giving some platform all your data and your clients too.
- Building it yourself is expensive and slow.

### More observations

Some newer players operate here:
- (the original) Intercom.com: add custom touch points with your customer.
- Cord.com: add collaboration to your product.
- MagicBell.com: add notifications to your product.
