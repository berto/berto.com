# Thesis: Intercom for X

### Intro

I come at this thesis from 2 angles.
- Engineering is the largest cost bucket for most startups and online businesses.
- Speed, including release speed, is a great opportunity for differentiation and value add.

The faster you can build your product, the more you can iterate, fail, learn, and ultimately succceed in solving your users problems. The faster you build a product, the faster you can deliver quality too. 

A company that delivers fast quality is great for investors too, who succeed on the upside of a few outcomes and who accept a majority of duds.

### The thesis

Intercom offers companies a simple solution:
- you add two lines of code to your software
- you pay them a (big) monthly fee
- they give you a solution for connecting to your customers at any time, in different ways
    - they started out with a Chat (for support)
    - then they automated that support with quick answers (bots)
    - they now offer other solutions, like pro-active guides for onboarding, messages etc.

The beauty of their solution is that once you add the code snippet, almost everything is automatic and configurable in their platform.

No more engineering time, launching experiments, etc.


### Key ingredients & benefits

- Full-stack tech: they include back-end, front-end, UI customization, automations, data collection, etc.
- Low-code: you add their software once via the code customization.

The benefit is that marketing team gets unconstrained by the speed of tech. 

### Other players
