# ✋ five levels of support

Let's box support into 5 basic levels:

1. Friends, Family & Fans: I’ll support you no matter what.
2. Close business partners: If you do X, I’ll give you Y.
3. Clients: Show me what you got, then I’ll decide.
4. Disappointed: Unless you change X, I will leave.
5. Lost: I want out.

It's important to recognize which role you're playing and provide the correct level (or more!).

As an angel investor, I always try to establish a close business partner connection. As a client, I generally wait for an iphone or new ebike to decide if i'll buy it. But i'm also frequently a fanboy (apple) and may buy nonetheless!
