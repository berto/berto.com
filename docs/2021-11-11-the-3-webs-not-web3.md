# ~web3~ 3 webs

I suspect we're not going to see the rise of a Web3 as advertised.

_Meta (Facebook's Meta), Sorare, CryptoPunks, Apes, loot, DeFi_. There's a lot going on on the crypto space and the metaverse and many swear that just beyond the horizon is the Web3. And why wouldn't we call something that follows the current web (web 2.0) web3? You would want to call it that. A web3 let's us dream about a better future filled with a decentralized economy, creators, VR, and riches. Most of all, the web3 lets us online nerds ignore the problems of our current Internet and build something new. And it lets everyone rally around a single marketing term, and raise billions of dollars in capital to keep the loop turning. That's all good.

I don't think this web3 will happen. Not anytime soon. 

What I think will happen is the internet splitting into 3 separate webs.

First, I propose a test for what can constitute a "new web version". The internet can be said to have reached a new version when:
- a majority of internet users interact with services and among themselves in novel ways.
- the fastest growing services and the ones with the biggest societal impact are built on top of it.
- the technologies and skills required to build for it are a standard for most developers.

My definition hinges mostly on the character of a new web version becoming big and powerful enough to stay forever.
