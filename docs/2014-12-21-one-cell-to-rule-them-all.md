# One cell to rule them all

For some time now ([link](https://web.archive.org/web/20141221112029/http://www.patife.com/) I've been fascinated with the potential of spreadsheets cells as the building blocks of programs. They could open General Purpose Computing to the next 1 billion application builders.

Spreadsheets have outgrown their humble beginnings. They started as an accounting tool. Now they power just about any task and department:

* lead generation
* planning marketing campaigns
* building dashboards
* converting, cleaning, exporting data
* managing HR processes (recruitment)
* tracking inventory
* creating complex data models

Why? Because they are very simple to use[*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet):

* They are 2D. It's quite intuitive to use table rows and cols to define program relationships. 
* They are progressive. You can start small and grow data and logic. They are also forgiving, allowing parts of the program to work even when others are unfinished or broken.
* They're visual. You can add cues about the meaning of cells, like colors and typefaces.
* They're powerful. Their functions effortlessly perform operations on data, like `min`, `max`, etc.
* They are ops-free. No need to compile or deploy them. They can also be shared with others.

This makes them great **to build custom tools that are easy to maintain**. Non-techies find programming hard; maintaining applications is even harder. Spreadsheets provide the benefits without those problems.

In fact, if we abstract them, they are already close to a generic program or a computer.

<tr><td><b>Spreadsheet</b></td><td><b>Program</b></td><td><b>Computer</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Formulas</td><td>Logic</td><td>Processing</td></tr>
<tr><td>Precedents/ dependents</td><td>Triggers/ side-effects</td><td>I/O</td></tr>
<tr><td>Values (displayed)</td><td>UI</td><td>I/O</td></tr>
<tr><td>Values (stored)</td><td>Database/ persistence</td><td>Storage</td></tr>
</table>

Classic spreadsheets are still behind on things like UI, automation or APIs. They are needlessly ugly and static for today's day and age. 

I have started a company to do fix this with others who feel the same pains. We a are building [dashdash](http://dashdash.com), an **app creator with a spreadsheet interface**!

* we empower end-users as creators, giving them access to modern computation like data & APIs in a spreadsheet;
* we generate slick shareable web apps giving creators a wider audience for their spreadsheets;
* we connect creators to catalyze and expand a community of a billion strong spreadsheet users.
