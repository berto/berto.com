# 2014-12-21 One cell to rule them all (updated)

For some time now ([link](https://web.archive.org/web/20141221112029/http://www.patife.com/)) I've been fascinated with the potential of spreadsheet cells as the building blocks of programs. They could open General Purpose Computing to the next 1 billion application builders.

Spreadsheets have outgrown their humble beginnings. They started as an accounting tool. Now they power just about any task and department:

* lead generation
* planning marketing campaigns
* building dashboards
* converting, cleaning, exporting data
* managing HR processes (recruitment)
* tracking inventory
* creating complex data models

Why? Because they are very simple to use ([link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet)):

* They are 2D. It's quite intuitive to use table rows and cols to define program relationships. 
* They are progressive. You can start with a small calculator and grow by adding more data and logic. 
* They are also forgiving, allowing parts of the program to work even when others are unfinished or broken.
* They're visual. You can add cues about the meaning of cells, like colors and typefaces.
* They're powerful. Their functions effortlessly perform operations on data, like `min`, `max`, etc.
* They are ops-free. No need to compile or deploy them. They can also be shared with others.

This makes them great **to build custom tools that are easy to maintain**. Non-techies find programming hard; maintaining applications is even harder. Spreadsheets provide the benefits without those problems.

In fact, if we abstract them, they are already close to a generic program or a computer.

| Spreadsheet   | Program  | Computer        |
| :------------ | :------- | :-------------- |
| Formulas      | Logic    | Processing      |
| Dependencies  | Triggers | Input/ Output   |
| Cells         | UI       | Input/ Output   |
| Values        | DB       | Storage         |

Classic spreadsheets are still behind on things like UI, automation or APIs. They are needlessly ugly and static for today's day and age. 

I have started a company to fix this with others who feel the same pains. We are building [Rows](http://rows.com), a **new spreadsheet, with data Integrations and slick, Live Sharing.**!

* we empower end-users as creators, giving them access to modern computation like data & APIs in a spreadsheet;
* we generate slick shareable web apps giving creators a wider audience for their spreadsheets;
* we connect creators to catalyze and expand a community of a billion strong spreadsheet users.

You can follow Rows on twitter. ([link](https://twitter.com/rowsHQ)).
