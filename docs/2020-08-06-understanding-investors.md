Some thoughts on investors collected from my experience and conversations with other founders!

Most investors:

* Are very smart people and are connected to other smart people.
* Really want to see you succeed, wether or not they invested in you.
* Ask interesting questions when looking at your data.
* Have difficult schedules and travel a lot. That is hard work.
* Are personally relatable and have cool interests. They understand the need to rest and family time. 
* Will give you space for you to experiment.

On the slightly negative side, a majority of investors:

* Are very busy and spread too thin. They will forget what you tell them from meeting to meeting (sometimes within the meeting) and repeat questions a lot. 
* Overvalue plans. Plans are important, but challenges have tremendous uncertainty, variability and interdependence. That's why kanban is so popular! Some investors, and some founders (me) gravitate towards to overplanning.
* Are insecure. Investor signaling is hard, and most suffer a lot from "me too" dynamics.
* Deal driven. Frequently, investors don't really understand or voice opinions on important tech trends.

The minority of Outstanding investors:

* Always give more than they ask. They are active ambassadors, users, product team members, etc.
* Have unique, god-view insights into your product and users.
* Have great taste.
* Are opinionated and useful when benchmarking your business, qualitatively and quantitatively (like metrics). They'll tell you what doesn't need fixing, and what does.
* Get you in contact with other people who also have the traits above.
