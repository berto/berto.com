# Tyler Durden

(Contains spoilers of the movie Fight Club).

In the 1999 movie Fight Club there are two main characters. One is the Narrator and is played by Ed Norton, and the other is called Tyler Durden and he's played by Brad Pitt. At the end, the narrator discovers that Tyler Durden is himself on steroids.

The regular Narrator dresses regularly and likes normal so to speak. But he is not the one with the good ideas, he gets hit more often than not, he is frail. Tyler is the one getting all the action (sex included).

That looks a lot like being an entrepreneur. We _are_ normal people. But at the same time we aren't. On top of our nerdy characters we build our alter ego who is a crazier confident person of the life we want for ourselves and for others. The person who keeps thinking about our mission, a parallel will who compels us to chase that dream, to fight against difficult odds. A persona who belives in a different society, efficient but playful. An underground hero. The wildest version of ourselves. A kids heart with access to an adult's reasoning and tools.

Tyler. Durden.
