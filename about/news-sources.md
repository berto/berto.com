### News Sources
_Updated on 2024-12-26._

This is my current list of news sources.

**World news**

* [The Economist](https://www.economist.com) `Paid`. Global news that cover the economy, politics, sports and culture. 
* [Washington Post](https://www.wapo.com) `Freemium`. I read most headlines, and usually deep dive on USA society topics. 
* Reuters for Apple TV. Up-to-date news in video format. The app auto-generates your choice of 10min, 15min or 30min of news. I love it, watch it about once per day when at home. 

**Technology**

* [Dithering podcast](https://dithering.fm) `Paid`. Daily 15 min commentary on Tech, by Ben Thompson and John Gruber. I don't miss a show. 
* [Stratechery](https://www.stratechery.com) `Paid`. Daily analysis of important Tech news with a strategy and business angle. Written by Ben Thompson. Articles are interesting, carefully written and feature non-trivial commentary on economic, legal and political issues. I read every single email in full. 
* [This Week In Startups](https://www.thisweekinstartups.com) `Freemium`. Daily short news on what's going on in Tech.
* [Daring Fireball: The Talk Show podcast](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/) Weekly podcast by John Gruber, the creator of Markdown and a long-time Apple commentator. I listen to about 50% of the episodes, mostly on long trips.
* [ATP podcast](https://atp.fm) Fun, weekly podcast that covers tech, Apple and programming. I listen to about 25% of the episodes, mostly on long trips. 

**Comics**

* [The Perry Bible Fellowship](https://pbfcomics.com/) ([x](https://x.com/PBFcomics)). Acid.
* [XKCD](https://xkcd.com) ([X](https://x.com/xkcd)). One of the original internet comics, nerdy and scientific humor. 
* [Tom Gauld](https://tomgauld.com/) ([X](https://x.com/tomgauld)). Pretty, scientific, tasteful.
* [War and Peas](https://x.com/warandpeass)). Edgy, nerdy, provocative.
* [Strange Planet](https://www.instagram.com/nathanwpylestrangeplanet/): "Images that cause laughter".

**Portugal**

* [Governo Sombra](https://www.tsf.pt/programa/governo-sombra.html) Commentary on Portuguese and World news. It's a great form of commentary. The 3 participants (+1 host) focus a lot on who said what and how; less than the actual content, like economic or social news; but in doing that, they expose very good points. I hear the podcast only, and never miss a single show. 
* [Extremamente Desagrad√°vel]([https://www.tsf.pt/programa/governo-sombra.html](https://rr.sapo.pt/extremamente-desagradavel)) Humor and commentary on Portuguese news. I'll listen to about 10% of them.
