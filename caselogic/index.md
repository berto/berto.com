Porto, 2023-07-04

I had an interesting chat about the social origins of the music we listen to.

Besides the clear influence my father had, most of my music came from my friends. I didn't have a radio, walkman, discman, or weekly allowance to go out at night. But they did!

I heard Ornatos for the first time in 2000-2001, when I was already in high school. They are a great Portuguese band because they make great music. I got Ornatos through the local kids group from Foco. Several of my friends had already been listening to them since 1998.

For example, my friend João Inácio from that group has always been a big fan of Portuguese bands and alternative rock. When I brought up the topic, I discovered that while I was jumping between 286, 386, and 486 DX2 computers, he was already deep into Smashing Pumpkins, first with Siamese Dream and then with Mellon Collie, and Oasis with Morning Glory. It was his older sister, Joana, who took him to the 1992 GNR concert for the Rock in Rio Douro album, and then to the Smashing Pumpkins concert in 1997 at the Alfândega, at the Imperial festival. When we asked his sister, we found out that Smashing Pumpkins was already a cult band among the group of friends of the 70s generation, probably influenced by a "Kiko."

Our friend Francisco (another Kiko) listened to a lot of music, which was "everywhere." In 2000, his 16th birthday party had our friends João Aires and Calvário as DJs. They also had a band, Open Mind, in 1999. Our friend Aires was older (about 2 years?) and a bit crazier, which greatly increased the variety of music he listened to, from electronic music to St Germain to Paco de Lucia. He also picked up a lot of music from his brothers but reminded us all of Voxx, which started in 1998 and later came to Porto with Miguel Bacelar's jingle voice. "Voxx, a yellow radio in a gray country."

Yes, I listened to Voxx in the car that Filipe borrowed from his father, and in Tiago's metallic blue Aixam microcar, and when I went to meet Gonçalo in Lisbon. But I didn't have a car, nor did I have my own radio. At home, it was all classical music, Queen, Chicago, Simon & Garfunkel, and a lot of Jazz and Blues. My father played the organ for the world, because he improvised a lot and that made the music spectacular. Otherwise, with many siblings, there wasn't much silence or introspective moments. In the car, our father used cassettes to keep us quiet and sang a lot.

Back to Tiago, he was more my source for everything good about The Doors and Bob Marley, and also some rare pearls in Portuguese bands like Clã; unfortunately, I also had to listen to a lot of Ben Harper and Lamb, and even Dave Matthews, who is the Mafalda Veiga of the Anglo-Saxon world. To compensate, he also introduced me to Pearl Jam, Rage Against the Machine, and Red Hot Chili Peppers. Tiago had a well-stocked case logic, even fitting the aliens from Blasted Mechanism, with some really cool music and some sci-fi B movie costumes. I also took the opportunity to call Hugo, Tiago's older brother, to check the influences. He told me that he picked up all those bands during his musical journey from 1992 to 2000, which were the musical genesis of his group. He also included Nirvana in the group, but that affected us less; in a boys' school, we were less inclined to the advancements of music for Emos. He picked up the music on Antena 3, on cassettes, and later on CDs he bought at the ON-OFF store in Carrefour. For more specific things, they went to Tubitec, later to Virgin. Hugo also had a Panasonic recorder, which he only used with TDK or BASF cassettes. At that time, there weren't many concerts, which emerged for the "80s generation" (mine), otherwise only in Lisbon and Vilar de Mouros. Electronic music appeared for him at Cais 447 in 1995/1996, with DJ Freddy, and they bought CDs at Parque Itália. The DJs also recorded cassettes, and they were also copied and distributed, as was done abroad.

Hugo also told me that he studied one summer in California (OC) in 1998 and brought back the Chris Cornell CD with black hole sun. This was 18 years before my time in LA, where I caught the first concerts of Arctic Monkeys and discovered some things from Roots and Rage, which I saw live. But this is already in the post-internet era and doesn't matter much for the story.

Jimi Hendrix kept appearing in friends' playlists, never failing and always cool. Looking at his songs objectively, one by one, it's a lot of performance and little original music. Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd were of a different caliber. They already existed at home and at my late Aunt Tété's house; they were creations with music and emotions and a healthy dose of "I don't care," without ever becoming depressing. Except for Stairway to Heaven, which is equally genius and annoying.

Filipe was always more electronic and fluid, scraping music from everyone, and I took endless doses of MTV at his house, I don't remember very well waiting for what. Probably the right time to go out at night. He had the best sound system in any of our homes, at least the one where we could turn up the volume the most.

I came to the conclusion that "everyone" had cable TV, with MTV (16), Viva (18), and Sol Música (15), things that passed me by except at friends' houses. My father was against cable TV for some reason that escapes me.

Paulo allegedly listened to Pantera from an early age, but since I met him, I associated him with Pixies and Nirvana, alternating between "today I'm going to Tendinha" and "yesterday I went to Tendinha." He caught Nirvana's Unplugged on MTV. According to legend, they forced the school van driver who took them to gymnastics in Boavista to put a Nirvana cassette, and they would do mosh up Avenida da Boavista. And where did all this music come from? The Pearl Jam CD was from Zé Tó. I asked Zé Tó, also a general friend of the group, and he discovered it in 1994 because it was advertised as Top at Valentim de Carvalho. Silverchair, Greenday, Offspring, everything that could be heard was heard, without shame. And Portishead.

There were projects that I picked up from who knows where, like Sam de Kid. Several older Portuguese artists appeared, like Rui Veloso and the provocative Abrunhosa, but without making much impact on our generation. Rebellious music for preppies.

There were also some pop-slows at parties with friends. No one had them, but the CDs always appeared at the last minute. Classic Brazilian music like Tom, Chico, etc., was played one way or another.

Lourenço Magalhães always had the best LPs and vinyls. Eclectic and electronic music was his thing. And still is. First, we asked, then we stole, then it was Shazam, and finally, music became accessible, free, and digital, and grew until it died, and everything ended up in the final algorithm.

Then there were the Guns n' Roses people, a band that scores like a Jimi Hendrix of the 90s Rock generation. Few originals of musical significance produced, but spectacular at the same time. Whenever it plays, it's good. Big Mac of music. Gonçalo Mendonça was the spearhead, at 9 years old he dressed up as Slash for carnival. In turn, Guns reached him through his cousin Miguel Fonseca, whom I couldn't reach. The biggest Guns fan was Carvalhosa, I called him to find out that he originally picked them up from the Tribute to Freddy Mercury that his older sister showed him in 1992. And that he's been to more than a dozen of their concerts, and is going to one this week (in Madrid). Carvalhosa's sister picked up Guns from her friend Mariana Machado. She got it from her older sister Raquel, who was friends with some surfers - Bagaço, Pisca, Bibas, Baba Lagos, and Freddy - the same DJ Freddy from above.

Back to the oldest of the group, João Aires. João started with Dark Side of The Moon and The Wall by Pink Floyd. These were records he had at home. A big influence on him was his older brother, Nuno, who took him to Drum and Bass parties in London. Once he walked into a store on Tottenham Court Road, heard LTJ Bukem, and freaked out. I called Nuno, who tells me he ended up there by chance: He was at the Ribeira with a friend, Pedro Mata, and they decided to do an interrail: He bought a ticket, but his friend backed out, and he did the interrail alone; He came back that August and went to Moledo where a friend of friends suggested that London was "the place to be." Be what? It was easy to pay for studies and have a good life. He headed for England. He was already going out every night in Porto, "imagine that," he told me. Here, he started at B Flat in original Matosinhos, in front of the City Hall, with Zé Barbedo, who was  crazy about music, influenced by his cousin's Pink Floyd records. They went to Cais 447, Griffons, later Indústria. There in England, it was more "what's around me?", and with his cowboy friends, they went everywhere. Jazz at Ronnie Scotts, trance, garage, etc. - at Avenue and Dragon Fly. He had the case Logic with CDs he copied from friends and passed from one side to the other. During the holidays, there was nothing else to do, coming to Portugal was total Rock n Roll, psychedelic trance parties, and raves. In turn, Nuno copied from his older brothers, Luís and Pedro, who even had a rock band, Chance.

In turn, our Aires went out a lot in the Ribeira, with Gonçalo and others. Gonçalo had moved to Lisbon in high school, and seemed a bit indecisive, developing a Chapitô personality. I got Da Weasel from him, and Jamiroquai from Nuno Cordeiro. Gonçalo also had older sisters, Inês and Sofia. I went to ask. Inês never bought much music, started with cassettes, and exchanged albums with friends. She doesn't remember very well. She got Bjork from a Teresa, and like almost everyone, she also picked up her father's music, Bee Gees and Vangelis. Guns N’ Roses came from Sofia, who in turn picked it up from friends...
